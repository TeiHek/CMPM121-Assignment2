# CMPM121-Assignment1
Creation of a simple scene in Unity

## The Scene
The scene shows a bear in some ruins with signs of combat around.
It contains crumbled building parts some weapons and arrows strewn about, and a bear that stands around amidst the ruins.
The scene is mostly inspired by open-world and exploration games, such as Breath of the Wild and Valheim, where previous signs of civilization are all about.
The main character of this scene is the bear, which gets the first-person perspective camera.
